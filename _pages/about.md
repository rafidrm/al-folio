I am an AI Resident for 2020-2021 at the NVIDIA Toronto AI Lab. I recently completed my PhD at the Department of Mechanical and Industrial Engineering, before which I completed my MASc at the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, both at the University of Toronto. 


My research interests span deep learning, data-driven optimization, and information theory. I have applied my research towards personalized healthcare, portfolio optimization, and real-time error correction codes. Outside of research, I have also worked on sports analytics and quantitative finance.


I am also an avid traveller. In 2017, I completed a personal milestone of traveling to every continent (not including Antarctica). My current wish list of future destinations include Azerbaijan and South Africa.

I am a PhD student with the Department of Mechanical and Industrial Engineering at the University of Toronto. My supervisor is [Professor Timothy C. Y. Chan](http://chan.mie.utoronto.ca). My research interests lie in the union of constrained optimization, information theory, and deep learning, for health care, sports analytics, and quantitative finance.

In 2015, I completed my Masters of Applied Science with the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of Toronto under [Professor Ashish Khisti](https://www.comm.utoronto.ca/~akhisti/), where I worked on coding theory for real-time multimedia streaming.
