Knowledge-based planning (KBP) is an automated approach to radiation therapy treatment planning that involves first predicting a desirable treatment plan, before correcting it to a deliverable one. Research on KBP is flourishing, but many results are reported using institution-specific datasets and evaluation metrics. As a result, comparing different approaches becomes difficult without a large open-source dataset, standardized metrics, and a platform to encourage collaboration, sharing, and benchmarking. Such an open and standardized approach is a staple in thriving machine learning-driven fields.

The aim of the OpenKBP Challenge is to advance fair and consistent comparisons of prediction models in KBP. Participants of the challenge will use a large dataset to train, test, and compare their prediction methods, using a set of standardized metrics, with those of other participants. This competition is hosted by the American Association of Physicists in Medicine. Registration begins in January 2020. Full details are available on the Challenge website.
