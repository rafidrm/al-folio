Prescriptive models in personalized applications are often formed as contextual optimization problems: instances of a common decision-making problem (e.g., designing treatments) must be updated in order to account for contextual information (e.g., personalizing for different patients). While personalization of the decision-making models is often performed by a domain expert, data on historical decisions can be used to train predictive models to automatically personalize the optimization problem for a given context. This typically involves estimating a context-dependent objective or set of constraints.
